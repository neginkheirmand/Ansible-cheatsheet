# Getting Started with Ansible 

This was the repo where I coded my first playbooks and followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT98CRl2KxKEUHie1m24-wkyHpEsa4Y70) tutorial with some custom changes.

The servers that I used were all test servers, the ssh public keys were deleted also, so don't waste your time on funny ideas :)

[This](https://github.com/neginkheirmand/Ansible-GettingStarted/blob/master/getting-started/ansible-cheatsheet.md) was my notebook(and cheat-sheet). I will definitely use it, so I would recommend you check it out too if you want to learn Ansible.
